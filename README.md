# 🚀 Leveraging Angular, Python, and Generative AI

*Build Smart, Scalable, and Seriously Cool AI-Powered Apps*

---

## 📖 Overview

This book  showcases how to combine **Angular**, **Python + Flask**, and **Generative AI** (Google Gemini & AWS Bedrock) to build powerful, interactive web applications.

It’s a guided journey—from setting up Angular and Python environments to integrating AI models that can **chat, analyze, detect, and generate** with real-world utility.
